### About this Course

Learn to create websites using jQuery, the world’s most widely-used JavaScript library. jQuery allows us to “write less, do more” by providing a set of functions that make selecting parts of a webpage and dealing with inconsistencies across different web browsers much faster and easier. No matter your skill level as a JavaScript developer, jQuery is an important tool to have in your toolbox!
